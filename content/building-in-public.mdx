There's something powerful about sharing your work before it's done. Not the polished case study — the messy, half-broken, "I'm not sure this will work" version.

## The case for transparency

When you build in public, you invite feedback early. You find problems before they become architecture. You build trust with the people who might eventually use what you're making.

Most importantly, you learn faster. Every time I've shared something unfinished, someone has pointed out something I missed. Not because they're smarter — because they have a different perspective.

## What I share

- **Weekly updates** on what I'm building and why
- **Technical decisions** and the tradeoffs I'm weighing
- **Mistakes** — especially the ones that seemed right at the time

## The uncomfortable part

Building in public means being wrong in public. It means someone seeing your code before you've refactored it, your design before you've polished it, your idea before you've validated it.

That discomfort is the point. It keeps you honest.

> The best time to share your work is before you think it's ready.

If you're building something, consider opening the curtain a little earlier than feels comfortable. You might be surprised by what comes back.
