Every week, I talk to operators who feel stuck.  

They think they know the problem — lack of clients, bad niche, wrong strategy — but they’re usually wrong. The problem is almost always deeper. It's not about strategy. It's not about tactics. It’s about clarity, focus, and execution.  

If what you want isn’t clear, the system can’t be clear either.  

### Define the Target  

First question I always ask: What are you trying to hit?  

Vague answers like "more clients" or "scale my business" don’t cut it. If you can’t define the target, you’ll never know if you’ve hit it. So start with the number. How much per month? How many deals? Be specific.  

Let’s say the target is $50K per month. Cool. That’s not a crazy number. I was doing $50K a month as a one-man operation — no team, no office, no VC funding. And no, you don’t need to be a genius, have a rich family, or get lucky with timing.  

$50K a month is good money, but it’s not insane. It’s achievable.  

Once you’ve got the number, don’t ask, “How do I get there?”  

Invert the question. Ask, “What won’t get me there?”  

### Inversion > Inspiration  

This is where most people mess up. They get inspired, make a list of things to do, and jump into action. But what you *don’t* do is more important.  

Be brutally honest with yourself. What’s holding you back?  

- Lack of focus? Stop switching niches every week.  
- Limiting beliefs? Write them down, confront them.  
- No accountability? Find someone to check in with weekly.  
- Too much tinkering? Automate and ship instead.  

You already know what’s in your way. You just haven’t confronted it.  

I had a member struggling with limiting beliefs. He didn’t think he could position himself as the guy who sells access. Sharp guy, but stuck. I told him to open a Google Doc, title it, “Why can’t I position access?” and write down every reason.  

Then, line by line, ask: Is this actually true?  

Spoiler: It wasn’t. None of it.  

Most limiting beliefs crumble under scrutiny. They’re shadows of your psyche. Confront them with logic, and they fall apart.  

### Extract the Advantage  

Once the path is clear, the next step is advantage extraction.  

Ask yourself: What do I already know better than most people?  

Everyone has something. You’ve been in rooms others haven’t. Seen problems others can’t. But you overlook it because it feels normal to you.  

Real example: A member wanted to start connecting but didn’t know what market to pick. I asked, “What do you do now?” Turns out, he’s been inside hospital implementations since 2020. Weekly calls with hospital staff. Millions of dollars in contracts. He knows the decision-makers, the blockers, the politics.  

The market was already cracked. He just couldn’t see it because he was too close to it.  

This isn’t about picking a niche. It’s about extracting one from what you already have.  

Your fastest path to $50K isn’t learning something new. It’s weaponizing what you already know.  

### Signals Are Already There  

Once you know your advantage, the signals are obvious.  

That same member — I asked him, “What happens during hospital implementations?” He talked about delays, vendor lockouts, and chaos. I stopped him: “Do you realize what you just told me? Friction equals problems. Problems equal money.”  

Every delay, every vendor scrambling to get in, every timeline slipping — those are signals. Opportunities, sitting in front of him every week.  

Signals aren’t hidden. You’ve been walking past them. You just need to start recognizing them.  

### Reposition as the Connector  

Here’s the key move: Stop thinking like a builder. Think like a connector.  

You’re not implementing software. You’re connecting vendors to hospitals during transformation cycles. High status. High leverage. High margins.  

Connector positioning is simple: X connects to Y. That’s it.  

From there, you build a system. Boring execution. Same checklist every day:  

- Scrape the signal.  
- Match to the right supply.  
- Route the intro.  
- Print.  

Wake up. Do it again. Yesterday, today, tomorrow — same thing.  

### Boring Prints Money  

The sooner you fall in love with boring, the sooner the money shows up.  

Boring is predictable. Predictable is profitable.  

It’s the same in relationships. The boring partner is the best one. No drama. No chaos. Just consistency. Someone who shows up every day.  

Your business should feel like that.  

Exciting means you’re guessing. Exciting means you don’t know what’s next. Boring means you wake up knowing exactly what to do.  

That’s how you cure “operator depression.”  

When your system is boring, your identity stabilizes. No more constant switching between roles — builder one day, consultant the next, then something else entirely. Your nervous system stops panicking.  

And the money just shows up.  

### The Operator’s Path  

Know what you want.  
Know what won’t get you there.  
Extract what you already know.  
Find its signals.  
Reposition as a connector.  
Build boring systems. Execute daily.  

That’s it.  

The rest is noise.
