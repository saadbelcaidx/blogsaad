I change my tools a lot. But here's what's stuck around long enough to be worth writing about.

## Development

- **Next.js** — my default for anything web. The App Router finally feels right.
- **Tailwind CSS** — I resisted for a year. Now I can't go back.
- **VS Code** — with a minimal setup. Fewer extensions is better.
- **Vercel** — deploy and forget. The DX is unmatched.

## Design

- **Figma** — for anything that needs to look intentional before I build it
- **Linear** — the best product management tool. Period.

## Writing

- **MDX** — write in markdown, render as React. This blog runs on it.
- **Obsidian** — for notes that aren't meant to be published

## The principle

I optimize for tools that stay out of my way. If I'm thinking about the tool more than the work, something is wrong.

The best tool is the one you forget you're using.
