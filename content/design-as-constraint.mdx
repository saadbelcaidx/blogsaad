The best designs come from constraints, not freedom. When everything is possible, nothing is focused.

## Less is more (actually)

Every feature you add is a feature someone has to understand. Every option is a decision someone has to make. The goal isn't to give people everything — it's to give them exactly what they need.

## Constraints I set for this blog

1. **No dark mode** — one theme, done well
2. **No comments** — if you want to discuss, reach out directly
3. **No analytics** — I write for the practice, not the numbers
4. **Monospace only** — one font, used everywhere

These aren't limitations. They're decisions that let me focus on what matters: the writing.

## The Apple approach

Apple is famously good at saying no. Every product they ship is defined as much by what it *doesn't* do as by what it does.

```
Good design = knowing what to remove
Great design = never adding it in the first place
```

When you're building something, try removing features instead of adding them. You'll be surprised how often the thing you thought was essential turns out to be noise.
