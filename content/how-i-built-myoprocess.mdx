I don't come from tech. I don't come from money. I don't come from a family of entrepreneurs.

I came from a banned Upwork account and a long walk in Limassol.

I'm writing this because I think the origin story matters — not for clout, but because if you're reading this from a similar starting point, you should know it's possible. And I want to be specific about how it happened, because vague "hustle harder" advice helps nobody.

## Quiet before the storm

I started on Upwork selling automation services. It wasn't glamorous — I was grinding, underbidding, competing with other freelancers for the same projects. But to be fair I was learning fast. Every client taught me something about systems, about what businesses actually need, about the gap between what people say they want and what actually moves the needle in the real world.

The problem with Upwork — and I didn't see this until it was too late — is that you're building on rented land (literally). The platform owns the clients. The platform owns the relationship. You're just a profile in a marketplace, and the second they change the rules, you're done.

## Initiation

One day, I opened my laptop and my Upwork account was gone. Banned. No warning, no second chance — just locked out. At the time, I was in Limassol, Cyprus. New country, no safety net, no backup plan. Just endless walks and CJ Jung (my favorite psychologist) in my ears.

I went for a walk then had a weird visualization (mystics would call it gnosticism, nerds would call it your unconscious picking up patterns that you already knew), I call it downloading information from the collective unconscious.

What if I stopped trying to be the service provider — and instead became the person who connects supply with demand?

What if I was the marketplace?

I went back to my apartment and mapped the whole thing out. The infrastructure, everything.

Within weeks, I had my first clients. Within months, I had a real business. That business became myoProcess (which makes me now $192,000/month as of this writing).

So I guess the ban was a bliss, none of this would have happened if I hadn't been banned from Upwork, the worst thing that happened to me was also the best thing. Interesting thought!

The gap between "banned freelancer" and "running a $2M/yr business" is much smaller than you think.

The gap is not intelligence. It's not connections. It's not capital.

It's: Will you take the worst thing that happened to you and turn it into a framework?

That's it. That's the filter. Most people won't. If you will — the opportunity is there.
