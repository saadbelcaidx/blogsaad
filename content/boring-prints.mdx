Every week, I jump on calls with operators who feel stuck. 

Ninety percent of the time, the problem they think they have isn’t the real problem.  

It's not strategy. Not tactics. Not a new tool.  

It’s clarity.  

### What Are You Actually Trying to Hit?

If you’re stuck, ask yourself: what do you actually want?  

Not “more clients” or “to scale.” Those are cop-outs. What’s the number? How much do you want to make per month? How many deals do you need to close?  

Numbers only. Vagueness kills.  

Let’s say you pick $50K/month. Cool. That’s not a crazy number. I hit that as a one-man operation — no team, no funding, no office.  

It’s good money, but it’s not magical. It’s not reserved for geniuses or trust fund kids.  

So, what’s your number? (That’s a genuine question. Sit with it.)  

Great. Now don’t ask, “How do I get there?”  

Ask the opposite: **what won’t get me there?**  

This is called inversion. It’s the fastest way to clarity.  

Be brutally honest. What’s in your way?  

### What Won’t Get You There?

The answers are obvious. You already know them.  

If you can’t focus because you’re chasing shiny objects — switching markets, offers, or tools every week — that won’t get you there.  

If you don’t believe you’re capable of earning $50K/month, that won’t get you there either.  

If you have no accountability — no one checking if you’re doing what you said you’d do — that won’t get you there.  

If you’re spending hours on automations, pixel-perfect designs, or rebuilding systems you’ll never use, that won’t get you there.  

You know all of this. But you haven’t confronted it.  

Here’s how:  

1. Open a Google Doc.  
2. Title it: “Why I Can’t Hit [Your Number].”  
3. Write everything you believe is stopping you — every fear, every excuse, every self-doubt.  

Once it’s out of your head and on the page, it loses power. You can go line by line and ask, “Is this actually true? Where’s the evidence?”  

Most of it is just noise. Stories you tell yourself. Shadows of your psyche.  

Turn and face them. Logic kills limiting beliefs every time.  

### Extract What You Already Know

Once the noise is gone, the next step is leveraging what’s already there.  

What do you know better than most people? What’s in your head that others would pay for?  

This is your advantage. Everyone has one. But most people ignore it because it feels too obvious, too easy.  

I had a member who spent years in hospital systems. He knew how they roll out new software, who blocks deals, who influences buying decisions.  

But he couldn’t see it. He was too close to it.  

That was his market. He didn’t need to pick a niche — we extracted one from what he already had.  

Your fastest path to $50K/month isn’t learning something new. It’s weaponizing what you already know.  

### Signals Are Already There

Your advantage leads directly to signals.  

Same member, same example. Hospitals rolling out new EMR systems, vendors scrambling to get in, friction everywhere.  

Every delay, every bottleneck, every missed deadline — those are signals. Friction equals problems. Problems equal money.  

He didn’t need to “find opportunities.” He was already standing in the middle of them.  

You are too. But you’re too busy looking at what others are doing to notice.  

### The Choke Point

The next step is positioning.  

Stop being the technician. Stop doing the work. Instead, connect the work.  

This member isn’t implementing software anymore. He’s connecting vendors to hospitals during transformation cycles.  

Connector positioning. High status. High leverage. High margins.  

You don’t need to build, sell, or scale. Just connect.  

### Boring Prints

From here, everything gets boring.  

And that’s exactly what you want.  

Because boring is predictable. Predictable is profitable.  

Here’s what boring looks like:  

1. Scrape the signal.  
2. Enrich the data.  
3. Send the message.  
4. Book the call.  
5. Route the deal.  
6. Repeat.  

Every single day.  

Same checklist today. Same checklist tomorrow. Same checklist next month.  

That’s the flywheel. Signal, supply, route, deal. Print. That’s it. That’s the whole thing.  

### Excitement Is the Enemy

You don’t want excitement. Excitement means you’re guessing. Excitement means you don’t know what happens next.  

You want boring.  

Boring is waking up and knowing exactly what to do. It’s the greatest cure for confusion.  

And, by the way, it’s the greatest cure for depression too.  

Operators don’t have business problems. They have identity problems.  

When your system is boring, predictable, and profitable, your identity stabilizes.  

You wake up, you open your laptop, and you know: “I’m an operator.”  

No panic. No guessing. No chaos. Just execution.  

### The Path Is Already Clear

Know what you want.  
Know what won’t get you there — and avoid it at all costs.  
Extract what you already know.  
Find its signals.  
Reposition as a connector.  
Build boring systems.  
Launch fast.  
Enforce accountability.  

That’s it.  

Now go do it.
